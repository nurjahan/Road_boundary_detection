1. Detect edges using brightness, color, texture
2. Take pixels based on thresholding
3. Convert pixels X-Y coordinate to polar coordinate
4. Do clustering with the help of Dendogram
5. Do confidence assignment to each cluster
6. Take top ranked clusters
7. Show top ranked cluster by connecting each pixel of the cluster with line
8. show mean line of each cluster 
9. Do perspective filtering to each pair of the mean line
